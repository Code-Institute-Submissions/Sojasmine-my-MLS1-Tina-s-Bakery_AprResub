  * Click on ** use this template** and create my repository. 
  * [Repository name](https://github.com/Sojasmine/my-MLS1-Tina-s-Bakery)
  * From the settings, under the GithHub Pages, I choose **master** branch and clicked the save button.
  * My github page is published at [site name](/)
  * Back on the top of my repository pages, beside the green _gitpod_ button. I wrote a short description about my project linked in with my github page. I added Tina's Bakery as **topics**.

Forking is a making a copy of the repository:

 Steps to fork the Githug Repository
  * Log in into your Github account
  * Find the Github repository with you'd like to fork.
  * Go to the top of the repository page [here](https://github.com/Sojasmine/my-MLS1-Tina-s-Bakery).

  * Now, you have the copy of the repository on your Github account.
Clone a repository:
  * You have to determine the URL for the forked repository before you can _clone it_ 
  * Copy the URL an then use it with *git clone*
  * Remember that it is the copy you have to clone not the original repository
