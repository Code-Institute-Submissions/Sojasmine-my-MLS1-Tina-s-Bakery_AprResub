# 5. Deployment
To deploy the Github pages, I used the following steps: 
  * Before creating the repository, I used [Code institute student full templalte link](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
  * Click on **use this template** and create my repository. 
  * [Repository name](https://github.com/Sojasmine/my-MLS1-Tina-s-Bakery)
  * From the settings, under the GithHub Pages, I choose **master** branch and clicked on the Save button.
  * My github page is published at [site name](https://sojasmine.github.io/my-MLS1-Tina-s-Bakery/)
  * Back on the top of my repository pages, besides the green _gitpod_ button. I wrote a short description of my project linked in with my github page. I added Tina's Bakery as **topics**.

Forking is making a copy of the repository:

 Steps to fork the GitHub Repository
  * Log in into your Github account.
  * Find the Github repository with you'd like to fork.
  * Go to the top of the repository page [here](https://github.com/Sojasmine/my-MLS1-Tina-s-Bakery).
  * Click the Fork button on the upper right-hand side under your profile photo.
  * Now, you have a copy of the repository on your Github account.
Clone a repository:
  * You have to determine the URL for the forked repository before you can _clone it_ 
  * Copy the URL and then use it with *git clone*
  * Remember that it is the copy you have to clone not the original repository.
