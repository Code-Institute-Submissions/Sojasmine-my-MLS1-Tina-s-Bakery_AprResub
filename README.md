 * The code for navbar was taken from bootsrap. I added more nav-items on the link and changed the description.

![navbar](assets/images/navbarmenu.JPG)

   * I used *linear gardient* as the background color for the navbar.
    
I found the code on [w3 schools](http://w3schools.com) 
ink to the source code (https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/func_linear-gradient.asp)

The color I choose for the background is : 

`.menu-bar {
